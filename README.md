# LittlePrinterFrontend
A simple template to print some nicely formated content on your Little Printer

This is the firs iteration, the output look like this, my idea is to provide a simple and readable template you can use for your own proyects and some experimental layouts too. 

You can see an example of the current output <a href="https://igcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xtf1/t51.2885-15/e15/891500_625150704272506_1966721853_n.jpg">here</a>

Litte Printers are currently obsolete unless you update your bridge to use this repo https://github.com/genmon/sirius/

Let's print a better future for our little friends!
