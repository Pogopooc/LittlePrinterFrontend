# LittlePrinterFrontend
A simple template to print some nicely formated content on your Little Printer

This is the firs iteration, the output look like this, my idea is to provide a simple and readable template you can use for your own proyects and some experimental layouts too. 

Litte Printers are currently obsolete unless you update your bridge to use this repo https://github.com/genmon/sirius/

Let's print a better future for our little friends!
